        Newsletter Editor’s Notes

        Hello, Folks! You must be wondering why in the world you are seeing me up near the front row!! Well, I’m bowing to the popular demand of at least one person who suggested that the Avalanche Editor’s Notes should be near the front of the newsletter. As you can see it did not take much to convince me. As a reward for this expression of confidence in the integrity of my reporting, I have included a secret bonus picture somewhere in the Avalanche. You will actually have to read this edition to find it.

        I must say I was disappointed to miss the July 29th Pub Crawl as Linda and I were sitting our 11 month old grand babies (twins - Isaac and Ellie). Of course they are so incredibly cute that it was almost as fun as drinking beer. See the pictures of the Pub Crawl bunch on page 9.

        Then there’s the Greek Isles Cruise in June 2017. That looks like a winner.

        There are still a couple opportunities to help your club by volunteering for the Asheville Tourists fundraiser. This activity provides revenues to support our club and provides you the opportunity to see just how fast you can prepare a cheese dog with onions.

            I appreciate the input for the Newsletter provided by our ASC members. From ski race results to human interest stories, it’s all good. Don’t be afraid to email me directly at <a href="mailto:tbushar@gmail.com">tbushar@gmail.com</a> with your story and pictures. Your story does not need to be written in perfect prose. I generally edit, elaborate and embellish stories when necessary to generate interest.
