        Well, the United States of America has survived another Presidential Election. This time just barely. I am now thrilled to go to my mailbox and find much less than the two pounds of political flyers I had grown accustomed to lately. Whether you were for or against the winner and president-elect, I can’t think of a better way to celebrate or commiserate than by enjoying all the fun that skiing and the apre ski scene offer. And just remember that someone very important once reminded us that “seldom are your greatest fears or your greatest expectations realized.” OK, that’s as much editorial political philosophizing you are going to get from me.

        Be sure to read Bill Melton’s page 10 report on the November 10th showing of the new Warren Miller film—Here, There and Everywhere. With the amazing attendance and opportunities to win free stuff, it was a huge success. Bill is the local producer for Warren Miller films. I bet it won’t be long before we see Bill starring in Miller’s films sporting his secret Glen Plake hair style.

            I appreciate the input for the Newsletter provided by our ASC members. From ski race results to human interest stories, it’s all good. Don’t be afraid to email me directly at <a href="mailto:tbushar@gmail.com" class="content-link">tbushar@gmail.com</a> with your story and pictures. Your story does not need to be written in perfect prose. I generally edit, elaborate and embellish stories when necessary to generate interest.
