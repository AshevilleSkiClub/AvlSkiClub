        Let's head deep into the forest with our neighbors to the south, the Palmetto Skiing & Outing Club as well as several other Crescent Ski Council clubs. Trip Thompson has reserved a jewel of a campground for all of us to share in the Nantahala National Forest, called <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/nfsnc/recarea/?recid=48642" target="_blank" class="content-link">Appletree Group Campground.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        It's plenty close to the Nantahala River for rafting & Tsali for mountain biking. Hiking trails and fishing are also activities that we can pursue while in the forest. Pricing will be based on the number of campers present but it shouldn't be too expensive. Contact Michelle Shuford: <a href="mailto:skibumlong@aol.com" class="content-link">skibumlong@aol.com</a> or Tripp Thompson: <a href="mailto:trippthompson@charter.net" class="content-link">trippthompson@charter.net</a> with Palmetto if you'd like to join us.

        We will be rafting with the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). It will be $36.00 each. RSVP Required! Check in time 2:45 pm on Sat. July 11th. We have 25 spots. 1st come/1st serve. This will be a guide assisted trip... guides in every other boat so if you have experience step up and be the captain!
